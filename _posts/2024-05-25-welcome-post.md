Welcome to the Express Blog. We are excited to have you here!  

As we get started with this blog, some of the topics we hope to cover include: 
- Adoption of the OSSF scorecard
- The inspiration behind Express 5.0
- Details about the Security Working Group
- Intro to the Express Forward Initiative
- More..
<!--more-->

Our plan is to keep focused on posts by selected community leaders at first, while possibly opening it up to the community at large down the road.

But if you think you have a great idea for a post, feel free to pitch the idea! Find the instructions on how to create a post [here](/en/blog/write-post.html).
